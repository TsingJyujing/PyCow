Description
-----------
PyCow translates Python code to JavaScript code with the "MooTools way of class declaration".

It generally depends on the fact that JavaScript shares almost all of its semantics with Python,
so PyCow just has to change the syntax most of the time.

Installation
------------
PyCow is a pure-python library and is installed via the Python Distribution Utilities ("Distutils").
See http://docs.python.org/install/index.html#install-index. 

Examples
--------
Some explanatory examples can be found on http://wiki.github.com/p2k/PyCow/examples.
